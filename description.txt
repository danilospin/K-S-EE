Original K+S Model (version 0.1)
================================

This version copyright by Marcelo C. Pereira.
The K+S original code was developed by Andrea Roventini.

This is a full rewrite of the original "Schumpeter meeting Keynes" (K+S) model. Differently from original version, the entire the model was recoded into regular LSD equations. The only intended change was ensuring stock-and-flow consistency in firm entry process. There is no guarantee this version matches the results of original version exactly, due to intrinsic differences between programming approaches.

Model description
=================

The K+S model is a general disequilibrium, stock-and-flow consistent, agent-based model, populated by heterogeneous firms which behave according to bounded-rational rules. This experimental set-up allows for an in-depth, simultaneous analysis of the macro- and microeconomic dynamics, including the growth paths of the productivity and the GDP. 

The two-sector economy in the K+S model is composed by two populations of heterogeneous agents, capital- and consumption-good firms, plus a bank and the government. Capital-good firms invest in R&D and produce heterogeneous machine-tools whose productivity evolves endogenously and stochastically over time. Consumption-good firms combine machines bought from capital-good firms and labor in order to produce a single, homogeneous good for consumers. The bank takes deposits and provide (fixed) interest-paying loans to finance firms' production and investment plans.  Capital- and consumer-good firms hire homogeneous workers (in a centralized labor market) according to their individual adaptive demand expectations. The government levies taxes on firms and bank profits, pays unemployment benefits, imposes a minimum wage, absorbs excess profits and losses from the bank and keeps a non-explosive public debt trajectory in the long run. 

The process of firm entry-exit is endogenous in both sectors. Firms leave whenever market shares get close to zero or net assets turn negative (bankruptcy). Conversely, the number of entrants equals the number of exiting firms, so the total number of firms in both sectors keeps constant. Entrant firms finance entry through bank finance.

The capital-good sector is the locus of endogenous innovation in the model. Capital-good firms develop new machine-embodied techniques or imitate the ones of their closer competitors in order to produce and sell more productive and cheaper machinery. On demand, they supply machine-tools to consumption-good firms, producing with labor as the only input. Firms have access to bank loans to cover their possible liquidity requirements up to a ceiling. The capital-good market is characterized by imperfect information and Schumpeterian competition driven by technological innovation. Firms signal the price and productivity of machines to their current customers as well as to a small set of potential new ones, and invest a fraction of past revenues in R&D aimed at searching for new machines or copy existing ones. Prices are set using a fixed mark-up over (labor) costs of production. 

Consumption-good firms produce a single, homogeneous good employing machines and labor under constant returns to scale. The physical capital stock is composed by a set of machine-tool "vintages" associated with different labor productivities. Desired production is determined according to adaptive demand expectations. Given the actual inventories of the consumer good, if the current capital stock is not sufficient to produce the desired output, firms order new machines to expand their installed capacity. Machine-tool orders are paid in advance by drawing on retained past profits or, up to some limit, on bank loans. Moreover, firms replace old machines according to a payback-period rule. As new capital embed state-of-the-art technologies, the labor productivity of consumption-good firms increases over time according to the mix of (employed) vintages in the capital stock. Firms choose the capital-good suppliers comparing price and productivity of the machines they are aware of. Consumer-good prices are fixed via a variable mark-up rule over the (labor) production costs, balancing profit margins and market shares. Firms increase their mark-up rate whenever the market share is expanding and vice versa. Imperfect information is also the normal state of the consumption-good market so consumers do not instantaneously switch to the most competitive producer. Market shares evolve according to a (quasi) replicator dynamics: more competitive firms expand, while low competitiveness firms shrink, or exit the market. Firms' competitiveness is derived from individual price and unfilled demand.

The labor market is centralized, workers are homogeneous, and all firms pay the same wage. Firms, on the grounds of the received orders (capital-good sector), the expected demand (consumption-good sector), and the current labor productivity levels, decide whether to (i) hire new workers, (ii) fire part of the existing ones, or (iii) keep the employees. If the total supply of (unemployed) labor is lower than the total firm demand for new workers, the resulting labor shortage is shared among firms proportionally to the individual demands. The aggregate supply of labor is usually fixed and all unemployed workers are available to be hired in any period. The bank and the government employ no worker. Unemployed workers receive a unemployment benefit from the government. 

Workers try to fully spend their income (wage or unemployment benefit) on the consumption good. If total supply of the consumer good is insufficient to satisfy the resulting demand, the excess is saved in bank and turns into additional consumption in the next period(s). Workers cannot get credit from bank for consumption. 

Government bails out the bank whenever the total net worth turns negative by absorbing the failed bank liabilities and injecting a fixed amount of new capital. The bail-out costs correspond to an increase of government expenditure and, likely, to an increment of the public debt.


Example configurations
======================

The model come with some ready-to-use configuration files (.lsd extension), illustrating the benchmark and policy experiments proposed in the original paper:

Benchmark.lsd = same set-up employed in the original model (Table 1 of the paper)

Low_opport_capab.lsd = low technical opportunities and search capabilities (1.1+2.1 in Table 7) 

High_opport_capab.lsd = high technical opportunities and search capabilities (1.2+2.2 in Table 7) 

Alt_labor_regime.lsd = alternative labor regime with Psi2 equal to 0.75 and  Psi3 equal to -0.90 (4th regime in Table 9)

Please refer to the original paper (reference above) for details on each configuration.


R analysis scripts
==================

There are several R scripts (.R extension inside R subdirectory) ready to analyze the simulation results:

KS-aggregates.R = overall analysis of macroeconomic aggregates, including scenario comparison, time series plots, de-trended series growth stationarity, temporal correlation structure, Monte Carlo experiments comparison (distribution and performance)

KS-sector-1.R = pooled and Monte Carlo firm-level analysis of the capital-good sector, including scenario statistics comparison, size, productivity and growth rate empirical plots and fits to Gaussian, Laplace and Subbotin distributions

KS-sector-2-pool.R = pooled firm-level analysis of the consumption-good sector, including scenario statistics comparison, Gibrat-law and scaling-variance tests, and size, productivity and growth rate empirical plots and fits to Gaussian, Laplace and Subbotin distributions

KS-sector-2-MC.R = Monte Carlo firm-level analysis of the capital-good sector, including scenario statistics comparison, and productivity dynamics among groups of firms

KS-elementary-effects-SA.R = Morris elementary effects sensitivity analysis of the selected model responses for all model parameters, including sensitivity coefficients estimation and significance, for both linear and nonlinear effects

KS-kriging-sobol-SA.R = global Sobol variance-based sensitivity analysis using a Kriging meta-model, including alternative meta-model kernels selection, meta-model estimation and validation, Sobol variance decomposition for direct and interactive effects, and surface response plotting (2D and 3D) of top-influential factors

Other support scripts exist in the R subdirectory and are required by the above scripts. The scripts are configured to use the R subdirectory as the R working directory. Please add all the data required for the analysis (including LSD configuration files) in subdirectories inside the R working directory (the default is 'data'). There is a set of preconfigured test configurations (Sim1-Sim6.lsd in the data subdirectory) which can be executed in LSD and analyzed by the R scripts without any change. Subdiretctories 'ee' and 'sobol' contain test configurations for sensitivity analysis scripts.

The R scripts require the following R packages (and dependencies) to be installed from the standard repositories: LSDsensitivity, tseries, normalp, nortest, mFilter, np, matrixStats, gplots, rmutil, plotrix, extrafont.
